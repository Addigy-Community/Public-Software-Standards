# Public-Software-Standards

This is where a handful of Addigy users layout what we believe to be best practices for adding and managing software in Addigy's public software repository.

Obviously, this is a project in the works, so it's going to be pretty barebones for a bit. Checkout #addigy-pub-software in the MacAdmins Slack workspace to stay in the loop of ongoing discussion.
